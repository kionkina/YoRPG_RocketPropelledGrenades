FEATURES ADDED:
-leveling system: 
	upon defeating a monster, the players maximum health will be increased and the player will be healed
-dungeons get harder:

-Magic stat added: 
	The mage class uses a new Magic stat to do magic damge rather than physical damage.
-Monsters have a magic defense stat added: 
	Currently works the same way as defense, but applies to magic damage instead. 

CODE RESTRUCTURINGS: 
-changed specialize to be more risky. defense lowered by nearly half to have the attack raised by a large amount at first, but becomes propotionally less each time it is used.

-YoRPG now prints out more info in between rounds, giving a more detailed look as to what changes the monster and player have had.

HOW TO PLAY:

Upon loading into the game, you will be prompted to choose a difficulty. lower difficulties will have you face less enemies, while higher will have you face more. the hardest difficulty will force you int oa guantlet of 5 monsters.

the choices are 1, which is easy(usually 1-3 encounters), 2, which is normal(2-4 encounters) and 3(all 5 encounters guranteed).

After choosing the difficulty, you will be prompted to choose a class. 

WARRIOR(1):
A strong fighter. An all around character. has decent defense and decent attack.

MAGE(2):
The third strongest character in terms of damage dealt. Does magical damage. good if you want a challenge.

ROGUE(3): 
Is cunning and agile. has a high attack and a relatively low defense.

TANK(4):
Owns an abundance of health points. It has the highest starting health and highest defense of all the characters. Can take a lot of punches, but doesnt give the hardest. 

DARK KNIGHT(5):
Posseses remarkable stength. it has the highest attack of all the characters, but it very fragile and cannot survive a lot of hits.

ATTACKING

Once you have chosen your chracter, you will be thrusted into the dungeon. upon encountering a monster, you will be given a choice on how to act. You have 2 options: making a regular attack, or choosing to take a risk.

If you choose the first option(1), you will perform a regular attack. to do so, your stats will go back to normal as you take a regular attacking stance.

If you choose the second option(2), your stance will change. you will take a more free stance, allowing you to attack much harder, at the expense of your defense.
